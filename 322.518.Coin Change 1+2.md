322. Coin Change  
Medium

You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money amount. Write a function to compute the fewest number of 
coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.

518. Coin Change 2

You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money. Write a function to compute the number of combinations that make up that amount. You may assume that you have infinite number of each kind of coin.

经典 DP 题目。Solution：

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int coinChange_1(vector<int>& coins, int amount) {
        vector<int> dp(amount+1, amount+1);
        dp[0] = 0;
        for (int coin : coins) {
            for (int i = coin; i <= amount; ++i) {
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1);
            }
        }
        return dp[amount] > amount ? -1 : dp[amount];
    }
    
    int coinChange_2(vector<int>& coins, int amount) {
        vector<int> dp(amount+1, amount+1);
        dp[0] = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i <= amount; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < coins.size(); ++j) {
                if (i >= coins[j])
                    dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coins[j]] + 1);
            }
        }
        return dp[amount] > amount ? -1 : dp[amount];
    }
};
```

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int coinChange2(int amount, vector<int>& coins) {
        int n = coins.size();
        vector<int> dp(amount+1, 0);
        dp[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 0 ;i < n; ++i) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= amount; ++j) {
                if (j >= coins[i])
                    dp[j] += dp[j - coins[i]];
            }
        }
        return dp[amount];
    }
};
```
