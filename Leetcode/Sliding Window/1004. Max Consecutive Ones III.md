# 1004. Max Consecutive Ones III

Given an array A of 0s and 1s, we may change up to K values from 0 to 1.

Return the length of the longest (contiguous) subarray that contains only 1s.  

Example 1:
```
Input: A = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], K = 2
Output: 6
```
Explanation: 
[1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1.  The longest subarray is underlined.  
Example 2:
```
Input: A = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], K = 3
Output: 10
```
Explanation: 
[0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]  
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1.  The longest subarray is underlined.  
 

Note:
```
1 <= A.length <= 20000
0 <= K <= A.length
A[i] is 0 or 1 
```

第一眼以为是DP，但没弄出来。  
用滑动窗口可以很好的解决这个问题。然而我处理不太好边界条件，也就是对问题的规划不够明确。  
下面是来自lee215的代码（https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones-iii/discuss/247564/JavaC%2B%2BPython-Sliding-Window）。
```c++
class Solution {
public:   
    int longestOnes(vector<int>& A, int K) {
        int i = 0, j;
        for (j = 0; j < A.size(); ++j) {
            if (A[j] == 0) K--;
            if (K < 0 && A[i++] == 0) K++;
        }
        return j - i;
    }
};
```
